  <h1>MATE Slackbuilds</h1>

<p>These SlackBuilds are intended to provide a means for a user to build the
<a href="http://www.mate-desktop.org">MATE Desktop Environment</a> on <a
  href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a>.  Some of the goals of this
project are: (1) do not replace any stock Slackware packages unless absolutely
necessary (thus far, no packages need to be replaced), (2) keep the upstream
default theme and settings, (3) try to minimize outside dependencies as much
as possible, and (4) make it easy to build and install by using standard-style
SlackBuild scripts and slack-desc and doinst.sh files that we have become
familiar with by using the <a
  href="http://www.slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds</a> repository.</p>
<p>The scripts will be hosted in a <a
  href="https://github.com/mateslackbuilds/msb">Git repo</a> shortly.  In the
meantime, here are some obligatory screenshots of MATE 1.5 (the development
branch of what will soon be MATE 1.6) with its default theme and background running on Slackware64-14.0:</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Q: When will the scripts be made available? A: Soon!</li>
  <li>Q: Will there be binary packages? A: It will depend on demand. It might
  not be necessary because it is very easy to build the base desktop
  environment in about 30 minutes on any relatively decent machine.  The extra
  packages might take an additional 20 minutes.  The biggest issue with
  providing binary packages is the hosting space and bandwidth for the
  packages and sources.</li>
  <li>Q: Do the scripts build and run on -current? A: Based on limited
  testing, yes.  These scripts are developed on a Slackware64-14.0 machine but
  should work ok on x86 (32 bit) systems as well as those running
  -current.</li>
