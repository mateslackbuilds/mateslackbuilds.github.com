  <h1>MATE Slackbuilds</h1>

<p>These SlackBuilds are intended to provide an easy way for a user to build
the <a href="http://www.mate-desktop.org">MATE Desktop Environment</a> on
Slackware.  The scripts will be hosted in a <a
  href="https://github.com/mateslackbuilds/msg">Git repo</a> shortly.  In the
meantime, here are some obligatory screenshots of MATE 1.5 (the development
branch of what will soon be MATE 1.6) running on Slackware64-14.0:</p>
