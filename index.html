         <!-- Begin Content -->
         <div id="content">
           <p>These SlackBuilds are intended to provide a means for a user to
           build and install the <a href="http://www.mate-desktop.org">MATE Desktop
             Environment</a> on <a
             href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware Linux</a>.  Some of the goals
           of the project are:</p>
           <ol>
             <li>Do not replace any stock Slackware packages unless
             absolutely necessary (thus far, no packages need to be replaced);</li>
             <li>Keep the upstream default theme and settings;</li>
             <li>Try and minimize outside dependencies as much as possible;
             and</li>
             <li>Make it easy to build and install by using standard style
             SlackBuild scripts and slack-desc and doinst.sh files that most
             Slackware users have become familiar with by using the <a
               href="http://www.slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds</a> repository.</li></ol>
           <p>The scripts are hosted in a <a
             href="http://github.com/mateslackbuilds/msb">Git repo</a> so feel
           free to test and offer suggestions, improvements, patches, etc.
           Here are some obligatory screenshots of MATE 1.6 with its default
           theme and background running on Slackware64-14.1:</p>

           <p>FAQ:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Q: Are there binary packages?</li><li>A: Yes, there are 
             packages for Slackware 14.1 x86 and x86_64 available at:
             <a
               href="http://slackware.org.uk/msb">http://slackware.org.uk/msb</a>.  It is still advisable to
             clone the git repo and build the packages yourself but these
             packages are available for your convenience.</li>
           <li>Q: Do the scripts build and run on -current?</li><li>A: Yes,
           based on our testing. These scripts are developed on
           Slackware64-14.1 and Slackware64-current machines but should also
           work fine on x86 (32 bit) systems.  Please be sure to read the
           README.TXT, KNOWN_ISSUES.TXT, and CURRENT.TXT documents as these
           are updated to note any potential problems or issues.</li>
           <li>Q: So -current is officially supported?</li>
           <li>A: Not exactly.  Since Slackware -current is a moving target,
           there is no guarantee that MATE SlackBuilds will build or install
           on Slackware -current.  Only a full install of the latest
           Slackware release is officially supported.</li>
           <li>Q: I'm getting weird issues with the panel, menu, icons, or
           other such things.  What's up?</li>
           <li>A: This is rare, but if it happens, check the KNOWN_ISSUES.TXT
           and other docs.  Usually, these kinds of issues occur when there
           are conflicts with other desktop environments.  Backing up and
           moving certain directories in the user's $HOME (such as
           $HOME/.cache, $HOME/.config, and $HOME/.local) usually solves these
           issues.</li>
           <li>Q: How long does it take to build the packages?</li>
           <li>A: All the /base and /extra packages should build in 30-40
           minutes on any reasonably modern machine.</li>
           <li>Q: Who is behind MATE SlackBuilds?</li>
           <li>A: Willy Sudiarto Raharjo and Chess Griffin.  Please post
           bug reports at the Github repo or send us an email at
           mateslackbuilds@gmail.com</li>
